# Visualizing Earthquake Data with Leaflet

## Data

- United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'

- Tectonic plates data [here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates)

## Steps

1. Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
   * Set marker size and color based on earthquake magnitude.
   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
   * Create a legend.

2. Illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
    * Plot tectonic data on the map.
    * Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
    * Add layer controls to the map.
